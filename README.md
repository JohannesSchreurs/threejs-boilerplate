# A boilerplate for Three.js
Basic boilerplate for Three.js projects. It comes with some basic settings and included packages (SASS, Stats.js, dat.gui, TrackballControls). Packages are bundled by [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). 

# Setup
Use following commands: 

```
git clone https://github.com/JohannesSchreurs/threejs-boilerplate
npm i
npm run dev
```

If for some reasons you decide to build with using the boilerplate, you can use `npm run build`.
