# A boilerplate for Three.js
Basic boilerplate for Three.js projects. It comes with some basic settings and included packages (SASS, Stats.js). Packages are bundled by [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). 

Clone it, run `npm install` and run `npm run dev` to get a server started on `localhost:1234`.

If for some reasons you decide to build with using the boilerplate, you can use `npm run build`.
